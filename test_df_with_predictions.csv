Donc l’asile dans les églises, donc on l‘a aussi fait à un certain moment parce que la loi le voulait mais pour finir, la famille, elle reste ici et elle a de nouveau des passeports et donc peut retrouver la légalité. En ce qui concerne les illégaux, enfaite personne n’ose vraiment faire quelque chose parce il y a aussi des groupements derrière, donc les passeports sont achetés, les tickets de transports sont vendues, donc qui est-ce que ose vraiment intervenir dans ces domaines-là ? Parce qu’il y a toute une mafia derrière et la mafia est derrière, elle est partout, donc dans chaque produit qu’on achète en réalité on paye une contribution à la mafia. Ce n’est qu’assez simple. Et donc ces illégaux et donc notamment ces traites humaines, notamment avec les femmes évidemment c’est un commerce très très rentable et je veux encore voire le premier qui ose vraiment intervenir. Parce que officiellement on ne peut pas faire grande chose, donc les églises travaillent dans l’ombre et on peut peut-être faire quelque chose, mais là il faudra avoir plus de moyens financières et donc à ce moment-là on a un demi-emploi et puis c’est réduit à un quart-emploi et puis encore une dizaine de volontaires qui travaille mais ça c’est la réalité et c’est là qu’il faut agir. Je ne sais pas comment on peut le faire. Merci en tout cas. [37:38]	"[34:42] I would say it's impossible to create laws that are rigid enough, it's useless. So the asylum in the churches, so we also did that at some point because the law wanted it but in the end, the family, they stay here and they have passports again and so they can go back to legality. As far as the illegals are concerned, in fact nobody really dares to do anything because there are also groups behind them, so passports are bought, transport tickets are sold, so who really dares to intervene in these areas? Because there is a whole mafia behind it and the mafia is behind it, it is everywhere, so in every product that we buy we actually pay a contribution to the mafia. It's quite simple. And so these illegals, and especially these human traffics, especially with women, are obviously a very profitable business and I want to see the first one who really dares to intervene. Because officially we can't do much, so the churches are working in the shadows and maybe we can do something, but then we'll have to have more financial means and then we have half a job and then it's reduced to a quarter job and then another ten volunteers who work, but that's the reality and that's where we have to act. I don't know how we can do it. Thank you anyway. [37:38]

Alors peut-être on va les laisser entrer, mais par principe, on leurs donne pas cette opportunité à les personnes qui n’ont pas de qualification. Je trouve que c’est un peu difficile car cela signifierait qu’on hiérarchise tout simplement les immigrés.

Kommen die Maghrebiner an, zwei Monate später sprechen sie. Nicht perfekt, aber sie sprechen ausreichend Spanisch. Sie verstehen auf jeden Fall alles und wir können sie verstehen. Also das Problem bei uns ist nicht derart gestaltet. Also es hat nichts mit der Sprache zu tun. Die Rumänen, es ist doch unglaublich, wie schnell sie Spanisch gelernt haben. Noch bevor sie in die Union kamen. Ich glaube, Not macht erfinderisch, sagen wir mal. Denn man muss da lernen. Aber Engländer zum Beispiel, die lernen kein Wort Spanisch. Also die bei uns wohnen, da gibt es eine ganze Menge, Deutsche und Engländer, und die bemühen sich nicht. Also ich hab englische Nachbarn. Sehr nett. Wir haben freundschaftliche Bande geknüpft. Aber kein Wort Spanisch. Auch nach längerer Zeit nicht. Insbesondere die Männer sind da nicht besonders. Offenbar haben die Herren der Schöpfung noch mehr Schwierigkeiten mit der Sprache. Vielleicht haben die Frauen einen leichteren Zugang. Wie dem auch sei, das ist die Situation. Insbesondere die englischen Herren haben überhaupt keine Anstrengung unternommen, um nur ein Wort Spanisch zu sprechen. Nun, um uns nun irgendwie zu integrieren, muss man es schaffen, mit Leuten, mit denen man lebt, zu kommunizieren. Nur so kann man sich integrieren. Nun die illegalen Einwanderer: Es wurde ja gesagt, es gibt keine. Also, irgendwie ist doch niemand illegal. Das ist ein Begriff, der nicht richtig ist. Wir können doch nicht sagen, ein menschliches Wesen ist illegal. Man kann illegale Handlungen begehen. Aber dass ein Mensch oder ein menschliches Wesen illegal ist, wo kommen wir denn da hin? [1:01:55]	"[59:38] I'll pick up again what was said. So the problem is the language. But with us, it's not a problem in Spain. If the Maghrebians arrive, two months later they speak. Not perfectly, but they speak enough Spanish. They definitely understand everything and we can understand them. So the problem with us is not shaped like that. So it has nothing to do with the language. The Romanians, it's incredible how quickly they learned Spanish. Even before they came to the Union. I think necessity is the mother of invention, let's say. Because you have to learn there. But English people, for example, they don't learn a word of Spanish. So those who live with us, there are quite a few, Germans and English, and they don't make any effort. I have English neighbors. Very nice. We have established friendly ties. But not a word of Spanish. Not even after a long time. Especially the men are not very good. Apparently, the gentlemen of creation have even more difficulties with the language. Maybe the women have an easier access. Be that as it may, that is the situation. The English gentlemen in particular have made no effort at all to speak just one word of Spanish. Well, now, in order to integrate somehow, you have to manage to communicate with people you live with. That's the only way to integrate. Now the illegal immigrants: it has been said that there are none. So, somehow nobody is illegal. That is a term that is not correct. We can't say that a human being is illegal. One can commit illegal acts. But for a human being or a human being to be illegal, where are we going? [1:01:55]

Und dann sagt jemand auch, diese Antennen, und gerade über die Medien, halt auch dann sieht man: den Menschen geht’s besser als mir und mir geht’s schlecht, ich habe nichts zu essen und ich meine, es ist nun mal das Menschlichste, dass man dann denkt: ich will da auch mein Glück versuchen. Ich denke, da gibt es auch ganz viele Theorien, dass wenn nicht etwas passiert bald, was die Verarmung in Afrika halt auf… also zumindest, das was stoppt, dass halt die Flut dann immer mehr wird und dass immer mehr Leute kommen, was ja auch verständlich ist. Also ich meine, wenn wir nichts zu essen hätten, dann würden wir ja auch gucken, wo kriegen wir was zu essen, wo kriegen wir, was die anderen haben. Das Problem ist natürlich, dass wir, gerade Spanien in der Situation ist, dass hier das ganze System gar nicht darauf ausgerichtet ist, insofern dass wenn viele Leute kommen, die auch gerne was haben wollen und sowas kann man auch nicht planen. Kann man natürlich nicht richtig wirtschaften. Das ist halt das grosse Problem, das ich sehe. Und was ich eben noch zu den Gefängnissen sagen wollte: das ist jetzt nochmal ein Bisschen ein Rückschritt, aber ich finde dass es in den Gefängnissen - Also ich war schon einmal in einem Gefängnis, nicht weil ich drin war, sondern nur als Besucher und es ist nicht schön drin und ich war vielleicht eine halbe Stunde da und ich glaube nicht, dass die Gefängnisse in Spanien viel besser sind als die deutschen Gefängnisse. Und man muss halt gucken, dass in den Gefängnissen Menschenrechte und halt wir sind nun einmal eine Demokratie  und da gehört sowas dazu. Dass sowas halt auch gesichert ist. Ja.

I think there are also many theories that if something doesn't happen soon that stops the impoverishment in Africa, at least that stops something, that the flood will become more and more and that more and more people will come, which is understandable. So I mean, if we had nothing to eat, then we would also look, where do we get something to eat, where do we get what the others have. The problem is, of course, that we, especially Spain, are in a situation where the entire system is not geared to this, in that when many people come, they also want to have something, and you can't plan for that. Of course, you can not manage properly. That is the big problem that I see. And what I just wanted to say about the prisons: this is now a bit of a step backwards, but I find that in the prisons - Well, I was already once in a prison, not because I was inside, but only as a visitor and it is not nice inside and I was there maybe half an hour and I do not think that the prisons in Spain are much better than the German prisons. And you have to make sure that human rights are respected in the prisons and that we are a democracy and that's part of it. That something like that is also secured. Yes. [1:06:23]

Deswegen versuch ich ja auch etwas langsamer zu sprechen. So, ich möchte also anfangen was das Thema Einwanderung betrifft. Ich denke, da sind wir nicht immer ganz ehrlich. Wir versuchen, darüber zu diskutieren, aber oft wird das Thema der Einwanderung nicht richtig durchdiskutiert. Und das ist manchmal wie ein Torpedo. Das Thema der Einwanderung wird zum Beispiel auch von den Arbeitgebern ausgenutzt. Oft werden die Einwanderer ausgenutzt von den Arbeitgebern für Schwarzarbeit, das ist nämlich oft die einzige Möglichkeit für diese Einwanderer überhaupt sich ihr Brot zu verdienen. Ich denke, dass Einwanderung, egal wie weit die Einwanderung geht, auf jeden Fall legalisiert werden muss. Alle Einwanderer, die in einem Land leben, müssen wirklich Papiere bekommen, da muss endlich ehrlich mit denen umgegangen werden. Wenn sie zum Beispiel keinen Arbeitsvertrag bekommen können, weil sie keine Papiere haben, dann ist das ja wohl nicht möglich, anders werden sie nur ausgenutzt. Und anders ist es wirklich nicht anders als ehrlich ihnen gegenüber. Wir haben ja wirklich auch immer viele Einwanderung in Europa gehabt. Es wurden immer Einwanderer gebraucht um die Arbeit zu verrichten weil zu wenig Arbeiter da waren und ich denke, dass muss immer auch berücksichtigt werden. Wir haben Arbeiter, wir haben auch schlaue Arbeiter und deswegen denke ich, dass die Arbeitskraft ganz einfach und richtig verteilt werden muss. Ich komme aus einer Region wo man sehr viele Einwanderer zwar mit den Booten sieht; man sieht das ja auch immer in den Nachrichten, dass sehr viele Einwanderer mit dem Schiff kommen; aber sehr viele kommen mit dem Flugzeug. Ich denke, dass das einfach auch vereinte Politiken geben muss in ganz Europa. Was wir nicht wollen ist ein Europa nur für den Gewinn, für den Profit und jedes Mal, wenn es ein Problem ist, ja dann teilen wir uns wieder. Nein, ein gemeinsames Europa. Einwanderung und die Probleme der Einwanderung sind ein sehr schweres menschliches Problem und sehr tiefgreifendes Problem und ich denke, dass wir alle überall Einwanderungswellen erlebt haben und irgendwann kann das auch uns treffen und da ist es dann auch so, dass wir auf jeden Fall auch Solidarität zeigen müssen. Das ist natürlich nicht einfach, aber ich denke doch dass wir auf jeden Fall dafür sorgen müssen, dass auf Ebene des europäischen Parlamentes dieses Thema richtig angegangen wird, damit endlich mal auch Ehrlichkeit auch in die Politik kommt. Wir wollen keine scheinheiligen Politiker. Nicht jedes Mal wenn es Europawahlen gibt dass sich niemand darum kümmert. Warum interessiert sich eigentlich niemand für die Europawahlen? Das ist ganz klar, wir wollen wirklich dafür sorgen, dass die richtigen Entscheidungen getroffen werden, denn wir wollen wirklich dafür sorgen, dass auch die richtigen Europaparlamentarier gewählt werden. Deswegen müssen wir uns alle daran beteiligen, das sind wirklich wichtige Themen, die hier bestehen und dass ist wirklich ganz wichtig, denn es ist ja wohl nicht gut, dass man immer von den Politikern hört, dass alles was gut ist, kommt aus dem eigenen Land und alles was schlecht ist, wird in Brüssel beschlossen. Wir müssen davon ausgehen, dass wirklich auch gemeinsame Politiken hier in Brüssel gemacht werden und da müssen wir dann auch wirklich auch dem Europaparlament die richtige Macht geben. Auch die Einwanderungspolitik hängt natürlich mit der Aussenpolitik zusammen. Da gibt es natürlich auch die Frage des Klimawandels, aber all diese Fragen sollen natürlich nicht die europäischen Länder teilen. Wir dürfen keine Situation, wo wir einfach nur sagen, wir sind die Besten. Nein wir müssen weitermachen, wir können uns nicht einfach nur ansehen, was in Amerika passiert. [27:04]	"[22:00] Yes hello, I'm from Andalusia. I hope that everybody understands me because in Andalusia we speak a little bit different Spanish. That's why I try to speak a little bit slower. So, I would like to start with the immigration issue. I think we are not always completely honest about that. We try to discuss it, but often the issue of immigration is not really discussed through. And that's sometimes like a torpedo. For example, the immigration issue is also exploited by employers. Often immigrants are exploited by employers for moonlighting, because that is often the only way for these immigrants to earn their bread at all. I think that immigration, no matter how far the immigration goes, must be legalized in any case. All immigrants living in a country really need to get papers, they need to be dealt with honestly. If, for example, they can't get a work contract because they don't have papers, then that's just not possible, otherwise they're just exploited. And there is really no other way than being honest with them. We really have always had a lot of immigration in Europe. Immigrants were always needed to do the work because there were too few workers and I think that must always be taken into account. We have workers, we also have smart workers and that's why I think that the labor force has to be distributed very simply and correctly. I come from a region where you see a lot of immigrants coming by boat; you always see it on the news that a lot of immigrants come by boat, but a lot of them come by plane. I think that there must be united policies in the whole of Europe. What we don't want is a Europe only for profit, for profit and every time there is a problem, yes then we divide again. No, a united Europe. Immigration and the problems of immigration are a very heavy human problem and very deep problem and I think that we all have experienced waves of immigration everywhere and at some point it can also hit us and that's when it's also the case that we definitely have to show solidarity as well. Of course, this is not easy, but I think that we have to make sure that this issue is properly addressed at the level of the European Parliament, so that honesty finally comes into politics. We don't want hypocritical politicians. Not every time there are European elections that no one cares. Why is no one actually interested in the European elections? That is quite clear, we really want to make sure that the right decisions are made, because we really want to make sure that the right European parliamentarians are elected. That's why we all have to participate, these are really important issues that exist here and that's really very important, because it's probably not good that you always hear from politicians that everything that's good comes from their own country and everything that's bad is decided in Brussels. We have to assume that common policies are really made here in Brussels, and we really have to give the European Parliament the right power. Immigration policy is of course also linked to foreign policy. There is also the issue of climate change, of course, but all these issues should not divide the European countries, of course. We must not have a situation where we just say we are the best. No we have to move on, we can't just look at what's happening in America. [27:04]

Et à la suite de la discussion, j’arrive à la conclusion aussi que des d’autres pays, ou la migration que ce sont deux choses différents. Moi, je trouve, que ce n’est pas par la migration qu’on va résoudre la pauvreté dans le monde. Ça n’est pas la bonne manière. Je pense qu’il faut le faire en dedans des gens sur place. La migration on ne peut la voir que dans la mesure où elle aide l’Europe à résoudre son problème de population, je ne trouve pas le bon terme, oui, par là - ce problème démographique. La migration est aussi nécessaire, là ou il y a une pénurie de main d’œuvre pour résoudre ce problème-là. Mais donc, finalement je trouverais qu’il faudrait choisir l’option que ça ne devrait être autoriser finalement, que si aie un vrai demande dedans les employeurs. C'est ça que j’arrive comme  conclusion. Finalement, on vient d’avoir au sein de l’UE une migration autorisée pour les gens qui ont une certaine qualification. Si on peut être référent. Franchement, on peut effectivement être envoyé au Pays-Bas ou Angleterre etc. Et l’en on travail. C'est l’option effectivement des employeurs et finalement, c'est ça que me plait le mieux.

And following the discussion, I also came to the conclusion that in other countries, or migration, these are two different things. I think that migration is not the way to solve world poverty. It is not the right way. I think that we have to do it within the people on the spot. Migration can only be seen as helping Europe to solve its population problem, I don't think that's the right word, yes, this demographic problem. Migration is also necessary, where there is a shortage of manpower to solve this problem. But, finally, I think that we should choose the option that it should be allowed only if there is a real demand from employers. That's what I conclude. Finally, we have just had within the EU an authorized migration for people who have a certain qualification. If you can be a referent. Frankly, you can be sent to the Netherlands or England, etc., and work there. And then you work. That's the option that employers have, and that's what I like best. [1 :12 :11]

So, aber das sollten dann meines Erachtens keine finanziellen Hilfen sein, sondern das könnten dann Hilfen sein, auf der technischen Seite. Was weiss ich, Wassermangel, irgendjemand versteht besonders viel von Wasserwirtschaft, der konzentriert sich eben auf dieses Land, das wäre sicherlich eine Möglichkeit, die nicht von der Hand zu weisen wäre. Aber ich würde es, wie du sagst, das für falsch halten, wenn jeder sein Geld irgendwo gibt, und das ganze eben dann versickert, das wäre schlecht. Das wäre schlecht. Und Geld ist Macht, das war schon immer so und das wird es immer bleiben. Und dann könnte von der EU ein entsprechender Druck ausgeübt werden: Macht etwas gescheites, bringt eure Wirtschaft wieder auf Vordermann, eure Landwirtschaft wieder auf Vordermann, damit die Leute etwas zu essen haben, damit sie nicht hungern, damit sie Geld verdienen ein bisschen, damit sie keine Idee haben, unbedingt nach Europa auswandern zu müssen wie auch immer. [73:41]	"[72:04] I would like to take up again what Agnes said: There I see at least once a chance to make partnerships - I understood that well, so there are partnerships within Europe between individual cities and the idea now carried forward, there partnerships between individual countries of the EC and, I say now in quotes, needy countries. So, in my opinion, this should not be financial aid, but it could be aid on the technical side. I don't know, water shortage, somebody knows a lot about water management, he concentrates on this country, that would certainly be a possibility that would not be dismissed out of hand. But I would think, as you say, that it would be wrong for everybody to give their money somewhere, and then the whole thing just seeps away, that would be bad. That would be bad. And money is power, it always has been and it always will be.

Often, they are persecuted in their own countries on the religious grounds and they are trying to find asylum in another country.

Dann habe ich noch etwas dazu zu sagen, meine ich, denn es heisst immer so schon: „Ein Arzt, der krank ist, kann keinen Patienten heilen.“ Wenn wir so weiter machen, dann sind wir der kranke Arzt und wir haben ja im Augenblick ja doch wo man hinguckt wirtschaftliche Probleme und die können wir bestimmt nicht dadurch lösen, indem wir illegale Einwanderer hier in die Europäische Union hinein lassen. Das geht nicht, wir sind krank. Also man müsste in diesem Punkt der Einwanderung etwas mehr konsequent sein, nicht „naja vielleicht“ und „mal sehen“ und so weiter.

Wenn die Kinder in die Schule kommen und können die deutsche, die spanische oder die italienische Sprache nicht, sollte man sie nicht in die Schule aufnehmen, sonder in ein Jahr Vorschule geben, bis sie die Sprache beherrschen. Die Kinder sind oft sehr, sehr intelligent, aber sie kommen durch das Sprachproblem nicht richtig in der Schule mit und werden immer weiter zurück gedrängt. Und das finde ich so schade. Man muss ihnen da einen Start geben. Man muss sagen: ok, es ist egal, es kommen ja auch Amerikaner, Franzosen oder sonst was zu uns, sie müssen alle, wenn sie in Deutschland leben, in eine deutsche Schule wollen, die Sprache können. Und wenn nicht, ein Jahr Vorschule machen. Das ist nicht getan. Das zieht sich durch bis in höhere Klassen, wenn die Sprache fehlt. [56:52]	"[55:12] I don't think we can blame only ourselves.

The children want to and the children are not allowed to. It's so bad and I don't know where to start. It's right with the language, what they said. If the children come to school and they don't know German, Spanish or Italian, they shouldn't go to school, they should go to a year of preschool until they know the language. The children are often very, very intelligent, but because of the language problem they don't really keep up in school and are pushed further and further back. And I think that's such a shame.

Angesichts der aktuellen Situation ist es unmöglich, dies wortwörtlich in Anwendung zu bringen. Wir müssen sie schon noch einmal auf die Realität zuschneiden, eine Art Mittelweg, einen Kompromiss finden. Und auch die Garantie dafür, dass die Einwanderer die Kultur des Gastlandes respektieren. Wenn man nach Europa kommt, ist es logisch, dass man die europäischen Gepflogenheiten akzeptiert. Da kann man auch von Integration sprechen. Es gilt, Regeln zu respektieren. Wer Moslem ist, es gibt schon Traditionen, oder kulturelle Aspekte, die dann eben in Europa nicht zulässig sind. Das muss man respektieren. Ana sprach davon, dass die Einwanderung von den Arbeitgebern reguliert werden sollte. Das hat auch wieder Vor- und Nachteile. Nun, ein Arbeitgeber könnte darauf aus sein, jemanden zu billigeren Löhnen anzustellen. Im Hotel- und Gaststättenfach ist ihnen die Qualität eigentlich egal, sie wollen einfach für den Kellner weniger bezahlen müssen. [19:33]	"[17:38] I agree with Thomas.

If you are a Muslim, there are traditions or cultural aspects that are not permitted in Europe. You have to respect that. Ana talked about immigration being regulated by employers. Again, that has advantages and disadvantages. Well, an employer might be looking to hire someone at cheaper wages. In the hotel and restaurant business, they don't really care about quality, they just want to have to pay less for the waiter. [19:33]

Ich habe noch die Bilder vom letzten Jahr vor Augen von Spanien, wo illegale Einwanderer kamen – also ich denke die Grenzländer grundsätzlich haben da eine ganz andere Thematik, wie Länder, die nicht so unmittelbar eine Grenze haben. Dann haben die einzelnen EU-Länder ganz unterschiedliche Arbeitsmarktsituationen: Die einen suchen händeringend Arbeiter, die anderen haben viele. Das heisst, es kann schon für ein Land sinnvoll sein, Immigration oder Migration zuzulassen, während andere sagen, wir wissen nicht, wie wir zurechtkommen, es wird schwierig, wenn wir noch mehr Leute ins Land holen. Also von da her sollte man doch lieber – meines Erachtens – diese Thematik vor Ort in den Ländern lassen, die es dann auch betrifft. Da kann man sicherlich keinen allgemeinen Status von der EU für Gesamteuropa überstülpen.

Then the individual EU countries have very different labor market situations: Some are desperately looking for workers, others have many. In other words, it can make sense for one country to allow immigration or migration, while others say we don't know how we'll manage and it will be difficult if we bring more people into the country. So from that point of view, I think it's better to leave this issue on the ground in the countries that it affects. You certainly can't impose a general status from the EU for the whole of Europe.

Das Problem ist wirklich wenn die Grenzen – da habe ich ein bisschen Angst davor – wenn die Grenzen offen sind, dass wir wirklich Verhältnisse kriegen wie in Amerika – Angebot und Nachfrage regeln den Preis – und dass ein Familienvater zwei Arbeitsplätze haben muss, um überhaupt seine Familie ernähren zu können. Wir haben hier ein System, das gut funktioniert und es ist ganz ganz schwierig; ich denke, jeder Mensch der hier nach Europa kommt und hier ein besseres Leben sucht, und wenn ich dem in die Augen schaue, dann kann ich keinem sagen: Wer bin ich, dass ich sagen kann, mir geht es gut, weil ich hier zufällig geboren wurde und du darfst nicht hier sein. Aber ich glaube, wenn eine uneingeschränkte Einwanderung möglich wäre, dann wird der Sozialstaat, den wir hier haben oder den auch Europa hat, nicht mehr funktionieren können. Wir müssen eine Lösung finden, wo wir einfach den Bereich des Sozialen auch abdecken können, was auch in die Richtung geht was vorhin gefragt wurde: Krankenversicherung? Soll jeder krankenversichert sein? Da habe ich ein klares ‚ja‘. Die Frage ist, wie ist so etwas bezahlbar und wie kann man es umsetzen. Und ich denke, es ist genau so schwierig zu sagen wir sortieren: Wer ist uns gut genug? Wer darf in ein Land einwandern? Ich mag mir nicht anmassen, zu sagen, der darf und der andere darf nicht. Jeder hat die gleichen Rechte. Aber wir haben wieder genau die Schwierigkeit, wenn die Menschen – Menschen sind Ware; Arbeitskapital, Humankapital; das sind ganz fürchterliche Worte, aber wenn zu viele Menschen da sind, dann wird der Einzelne zu einem nichts und es werden nur die Preise heruntergedrückt und es ist schlussendlich mehr für keinen etwas übrig. [28:31]	"[26:41] I also think, free market economy I don't think is good. We have the social market economy here and it's been very successful. The problem is really when the borders - I'm a little bit afraid of that - when the borders are open, that we really get conditions like in America - supply and demand regulate the price - and that a family man has to have two jobs to be able to feed his family at all. We have a system here that works well and it's very very difficult; I think every person who comes here to Europe and is looking for a better life here, and when I look that in the eye, I can't say to anyone: Who am I to say that I'm fine because I was born here by chance and you're not allowed to be here. But I believe that if unrestricted immigration were possible, then the welfare state that we have here or that Europe also has will no longer be able to function. We have to find a solution where we can simply cover the social area, which also goes in the direction of what was asked earlier: Health insurance? Should everyone have health insurance? I have a clear 'yes' to that. The question is, how is something like that affordable and how can it be implemented. And I think it's just as difficult to say we're sorting: Who is good enough for us? Who is allowed to immigrate to a country? I don't like to presume to say this one may and that one may not. Everyone has the same rights. But we have again exactly the difficulty when people - people are commodities; labor capital, human capital; these are quite terrible words, but when there are too many people, then the individual becomes nothing and only the prices are pushed down and in the end there is nothing left for anybody.

Die Muslime verstecken sich hinter ihrer Religion, weil sie mit Europa ganz schlechte Erfahrungen gemacht haben. Und das spielt auch noch eine ganz grosse Rolle. Auch jetzt noch wenn man sich mit denen unterhält, der Irakkrieg hat fürchterliche Folgen in der Mentalität hinterlassen. Das wird als ungerechter Krieg empfunden. Sehen wir ja auch so. Und was in Afghanistan teilweise abläuft ist teilweise auch kein unbedingt gerechter Krieg. Die Gefängnisse in Guantanamo, die der Westen gehabt hat, war auch ein ganz schlechtes Beispiel. Und wir haben schon ein Bisschen mit den Muslimen einen Konflikt, der historisch bedingt ist. Und der sich natürlich auch noch bei den Immigranten und Einwanderern, wenn sie hier schlechte Erfahrungen machen, wieder ausspielt. Es gab vor zwei Jahren eine Ausstellung in Deutschland, wie die ersten Türken, wie die in Deutschland aufgenommen wurden. Ich hab mich geschämt, als  ich diese Ausstellung gesehen hatte. Es war furchtbar. Wir haben diese Menschen wirklich als Unmenschen behandelt. Wie Tiere. Die kriegten ein Bett, das war an drei Personen vermietet zu einem Horrorpreis. Das ist Gott sei Dank vorbei und insgesamt kann man schon positiv sehen. Wir lernen langsam, die als Menschen zu sehen und auch zu integrieren. Und wir geben uns auch grosse Mühe. Das ist aber noch ein Weg, der noch Zeit beansprucht und den wir auch weiter verfolgen müssen. Aber ich glaube, das Hauptproblem ist, alle Menschen möchten in ihrer Heimat bleiben und auch die Immigranten möchten im Grunde genommen nicht weg. Aber in ihren Ländern sind derartige Zustände, da möchten wir nicht einmal in den Urlaub hin fahren. Und wenn wir mal abseits der urlaubspfade, wie sie alle schön präpariert sind, in die Dörfer, in die Präferie [Perpherie] gehen, dann sehen wir das nackte Elend. Und das Problem dieser Länder ist nicht die Demokratie oder Diktatur, sondern das ist das, was man „good governance“ nennt. Und die haben einfach furchtbare Regierungen. Wenn sie nach Nigeria gehen, das ist grauenhaft. Wenn sie im Kongo sind, das ist grauenhaft. Wenn sie in Mosambik sind. Überall Schreckliches. Und Europa sollte die grössten Anstrengungen unternehmen, wie es Einfluss gewinnt, dass die zu einem „good government“ kommen. Der muss völlig unreligiös sein, keine Diktatur, keine Demokratie, sondern es muss sein, dass die Menschenrechte dort eingehalten werden. Und da muss sich jetzt die EU zusammen tut, wie sie gemeinsam dort Einfluss gewinnt und Schritt für Schritt diese Länder und diese Regierungen dort aufbaut.

And you have to look at this again from the imperialism point of view. The Muslims hide behind their religion because they have had very bad experiences with Europe. And that still plays a very big role. Even now, when you talk to them, the Iraq war has had a terrible impact on their mentality. It is perceived as an unjust war. We see it that way, too. And what is happening in Afghanistan is not necessarily a just war. The prisons in Guantanamo, which the West had, were also a very bad example.

Donc on va prendre les meilleurs d’un autre côté. Moi, je suis pour la migration sélective, la raison en est qu’on ne peut laisser que venir les gens ici s’ils ont un avenir ici. Si ça veut dire que les gens qui arrivent ici ne trouvèrent pas de travail, ne seront pas acceptées sur le marché de l’emploi. Et vont devoir dépendre d’une allocation social, à ce moment-là, ils n’auront pas une vie agréable non plus. Alors il ne faut pas non plus leur faire cela. Et donc c'est pour cela que je serais quand même pour la migration sélective. [32 :15]	"31:26] Can I respond? This argument is right. It's true that we're going to have a sort of ""Brian drain"" as we say. So we're going to take the best from the other side. I am in favor of selective migration, the reason being that we can only let people come here if they have a future here. If that means that people who come here will not find a job, will not be accepted in the labor market. And they will have to depend on a social benefit, then they will not have a good life either. So we should not do that to them either. And so that's why I would still be for selective migration. [32 :15]

Die Leute wollen eigentlich ja nicht ihre Heimat aufgeben, denke ich zumindest. Das wollen sie, weil sie in einem unglaublichen Elend leben. Nichts zu essen haben, nichts zu trinken haben und dann wahrscheinlich übers Fernsehen, das sie dann haben, sogar noch sehen, wie es in Europa aussieht. Das heisst, wenn wir versuchen, dort Strukturen – wirtschaftliche Strukturen – aufzubauen, viel mehr Aufbauhilfe leisten und so weiter, ersparen wir uns sicher einige riesige Völkerwanderungen Richtung Europa hin, was auf Zeit sicherlich einerseits günstiger ist, als die Abriegelung Europas. Dazu bräuchte man massenhaft Militär, wir haben im Osten riesige Grenzen und auch aus dem Osten werden wahrscheinlich irgendwann die Völker migrieren. Und zweitens schafft man auf lange Sicht auch grosse Absatzmärkte. Die EU ist so erfolgreich, auch wirtschaftlich so erfolgreich, weil sie auf Kooperation setzt und nicht auf Konfrontation und auf Konkurrenz. Konkurrenz innerhalb, aber in einem bestimmten Rahmen. An sich im Grossen und Ganzen: Kooperation. Wenn wir das versuchen als EU weltweit durchzusetzen oder zumindest im grösseren Stil, dann können wir vielleicht damit [nicht nur] verhindern, dass Leute einerseits in Armut leben, nichts zu essen haben, nichts zu trinken haben, verhungern, verdursten, sondern können auch für uns Probleme beseitigen und wahrscheinlich sogar Absatzmärkte noch für unsere heimische Wirtschaft schaffen.

People don't actually want to give up their homeland, I think at least. They want to do that because they live in unbelievable misery. They don't have anything to eat, they don't have anything to drink, and then they probably see on television, which they have, what it looks like in Europe. This means that if we try to build up structures - economic structures - there, provide much more reconstruction aid and so on, we will certainly save ourselves some huge mass migrations towards Europe, which is certainly more favorable in the long term than sealing off Europe. We have huge borders in the east and peoples will probably migrate from the east at some point. And secondly, in the long run, you also create large sales markets. The EU is so successful, also economically so successful, because it relies on cooperation and not on confrontation and competition. Competition within, but within a certain framework. By and large: cooperation. If we try to enforce that as the EU worldwide or at least on a larger scale, then maybe we can [not only] prevent people from living in poverty on the one hand, not having anything to eat, not having anything to drink, starving, dying of thirst, but we can also eliminate problems for us and probably even create sales markets still for our domestic economy.

Donc je reviens toujours à ce point-là donc il y a 27 états membres au sein de l’Union Européenne on doit y avoir une possibilité d’approuver une loi qui soit soutenu par tout le monde et sinon ça ne peut pas fonctionner, ce que je peux très bien comprendre. Vous savez quand-même en France, en Allemagne les tribunaux sont surchargés. Si maintenant – il faut encore rejeter tout ce procès là, ça pourrait prendre des années, on le connait chez nous aussi. Donc certains procès il faut des années et puis il faut décider si les gens peuvent rester ou pas, ça prend des années et donc ce sont aussi des montants énormes qui sont utilisés et bien ces moyens financiers on pourrait aussi les utiliser pour mieux accueillir ces gens-là pour qu’ils puissent être soutenus dans leurs pays pour qu’ils ne viennent pas.

You know that in France and Germany the courts are overloaded. If we have to dismiss this whole case now, it could take years, we know that here too. So some trials take years and then it is necessary to decide if people can stay or not, it takes years and therefore these are also huge amounts of money that are used and well these financial means could also be used to better welcome these people so that they can be supported in their countries so that they do not come.

Mais d’une façon plus en […] c’est de se poser la question de qu’est-ce qui génère ce mouvement migratoire. Bon, le mouvement migratoire on a toujours eu. Tout en longue de l’histoire du monde. Mais aujourd’hui pour reprendre cet exemple de l’Afrique je crois que c’est au niveau du Sénégal ou il y a énormément de jeunes hommes qui prennent la mer pour partir rejoindre l’Europe. Ces hommes qui meurent à la mer. Et ces femmes sénégalaises qui se sont mobilisés pour tout faire en sorte pour retenir aujourd’hui leurs hommes. Donc c’est vrai que nous on peut faire éventuellement des actions, il y a des actions qu’un développement d’ailleurs un qui mise en place par le gouvernement français pour aider au montage des projets sur place. Donc on parle des pays qui génèrent beaucoup d’immigration. Mais bon, là on est aussi confronté a des logiques des moyens parce que bon, surtout en période de crises ou la question financière devient plus en plus cruciales. Y a aussi une mobilisation certainement a faciliter au niveau de ces pays pour que les pays se prennent en charge pour identifier réellement les motivations des parts et puis faire en sort effectivement que les populations ne se bougent pas. Alors il y a des différentes raisons; des raisons sanitaires et des raisons économiques et des raisons politiques. C'est sur que, la, quelques soit la solution qu’on met en place au niveau de l’Europe, on n’aura pas pour régler la motivation de la migration du fait migratoire. Donc c’est vrai, c’est au de loi de l’Europe c'est, ce qui est intéressant, c’est que l’Europe joue un rôle en [..] sur la modération de flux migratoires je pense. Qu’est réellement un rôle politique pour qu’au plan mondial on puisse réguler ces mouvements migratoires. [56:57]	"54:32] ... Indeed, we can take up an idea that has already been put forward in relation to, in fact, the problem of how to welcome immigrants and on what criteria between [...].

But there we are also confronted with the logic of means because especially in times of crisis where the financial issue becomes more and more crucial. There is also a mobilization that must be facilitated at the level of these countries so that the countries take charge of identifying the motivations of the shares and then make sure that the populations do not move. So there are different reasons; health reasons, economic reasons and political reasons. It is sure that, whatever solution we put in place at the European level, we will not be able to solve the motivation of migration. So it's true, it's in the law of Europe, it's, what is interesting is that Europe plays a role in [...] on the moderation of migratory flows I think.

Lorsqu’on est demandeur d’asile, il faut introduire une demande ; ils sont entrés de manière illégale, ensuite ils ont introduit leur demande. On vérifie ensuite la demande pour vérifier si cette personnes ont vraiment été persécutés. Il s’agit surtout d’une procédure qui concerne les persécutions politiques ou racistes ou autre. Donc tout cela est prévu, fixer par le législateur et c’est très détaillé. Et si ces personnes n’ont pas le droit, alors on les expulse tous simplement. Donc ils ont une certaine légalité pendant la procédure de demande d’asile mais si le contrôle est négatif, alors on les expulse. Alors, que cela signifie-t-il : ces demandeurs d’asile qui n’ont pas été reconnus en tant que [ ?] droit, est-ce qu’on doit tout de même leur donner de la possibilité alors de rester tout de même.

Je ne sais pas si vous comprenez bien. A cette équipe française… alors tous les français ont évidement fêté, parce que la France a été la meilleure équipe. En ’98, la meilleure équipe. Et en 2000 mettaient à côté le Portugal parce qu’elle était meilleure que le Portugal. Et gagné le final, parce qu’elle était la meilleure équipe. Ils étaient tous français. Tous. Zinedine Zidane et compagnie, ils sont tous français. Je pense qu’il est né au nord-Afrique, non ? Algérie ? Algérie. Mais il est français, ils sont tous français, d’ailleurs. Et tous les autres sont français. Donc les discours du passé sont un peu dérangeants. C’est […] française. Bon maintenant l’équipe de France, elle est mixte, enfin elle est portugaise, mais de plus en plus elle est de descendants. Le notre champion de triple saut, en langueur, il est né… fallait que ses parents sont Cap-Verdien. Il est né au Cote Ivoire, je pense. Mais il est portugais, enfin. Notre championne de saut en longueur, elle est née en Angola, elle est portugaise. Mais ils défendent le drapeau portugais. Mais cela ils travaillent. Donc ils gagnent des millions donc ils shoote le ballon, et c’est ça, voilà. Ils gagnent leurs vies. Mais donc nous devons savoir ceux qui sont les meilleurs, ceux qui ne sont pas les bons. Ceux qui méritent, ceux qui ne le méritent pas. Nous devons être tolérants envers la culture des autres. L’islam, par exemple. On doit les tolérer, évidement. Mais alors quand il s’agit du droit de la femme, notamment ça m’effraye. Ça m’effraye du droit de la femme. Dans l’islam, ça m’effraye. Mais dans certains aspects nous devons être tolérants. Parce qu’il y a des choses qui ne changeraient jamais. La culture occidentale peut dans certains aspects aider les femmes musulmanes à être plus respectée par ses pères. Mais il y a certains traits culturels qui ne se changeront jamais. Et religieux qui ne se changeront jamais. Mais nous devrons respecter la culture des autres. Si nous voulons êtres respectés, nous devons respecter les autres également. Nous ne devons pas penser que la civilisation occidentale est meilleure que les autres civilisations. De toutes les ordres. Nous ne devons pas penser de cette façon. Parce qu’autrement, c’est sur mauvaise base. Si nous voulons changer ce que nous avons fait pendant des siècles et de mauvaise façon parfois les autres, nous ne pouvons penser que nous sommes meilleures que les autres. Parce que la civilisation, le mot civilisation n’est pas née en occident. Civilisation, il y a plusieurs, il n’a pas qu’une civilisation. Ni l’occidentale ni une autre. Donc ça m’effraye, ce petit discours, sincèrement. Un commentaire en off, il y a une déclaration universelle de droit de l’homme. Qui doit être respecté par tous les peuples du monde et malgré ça, malgré le fait que les pays européens ne respectent pas la déclaration. Y a certaines qui… Si les pays européens ne la respectent pas, il y a beaucoup d’autres qui respectent beaucoup moins. Donc, nous devons tous ensemble, de façon universelle respecter cette charte. Parce qu’on s’accommode, on n’arrive pas à dépasser certaines difficultés. Et alors il y a certains qui mettent leur tête au dessous du sable, qui se cachent, ou alors qui regardent au coté, avec le problème qui est à droite, ils regardent à gauche. Comme ça, on ne va pas résoudre des problèmes. Et pour terminer… je vous promets dans les dix prochaines minutes je ne prends plus la parole. Donc la question démographique était divisée en deux - de la population de l’Europe et l’augmentation de population non-blanche en France et en Allemagne. Il y a des études qui nous disent que dans quelques destines, la population musulman peux même dépasser la population occidentale. Surtout en France. Parce que les musulmans en général, ont plus des enfants que les autres français. Ils sont tous français, mais il y a des musulmans, les musulmans ont plus des enfants que les français blancs. Donc je voudrais résoudre le problème, parce que les subsides, les compensations que sont donnés aux musulmans en France sont les mêmes que sont donnés aux blancs qui sont en France. Il n’a pas une différence. Tout le monde reçoit des subsides, des allocations. Donc ce que nous devons avoir, plus d’enfants. Oui, nous, plus d’enfants. C’est là, la différence culturelle. C’est ça qu’on ne comprend pas. Parce qu’on a un style de vie. On veut le préserver. Que c’est compatible avec un, deux enfants. Et même avec deux enfants, c’est déjà complique. C’est compliqué. On veut préserver ce style de vie. Et ces gens, en façon ces personnes n’ont pas cette préoccupation. Ils ont un autre style de vie. Et alors on a dit ici en off que en vie dans une tribune… non, on ne peut pas donner de l’essence aux autres. On n’est pas meilleur que les autres. On doit aider les autres peuples à évoluer et se développer. Parce que nous avons commit beaucoup des crimes, des erreurs pendant tous les siècles. On ne peut pas oublier le passé. On a commit des erreurs et des crimes, certainement. [38 :04]	"31:29] I don't know if you know... the World Cup '98... and then the French team won. For two times. I don't know if you understand well. To this French team... so all the French people obviously celebrated, because France was the best team. In '98, the best team. And in 2000 put aside Portugal because it was better than Portugal. And won the final, because it was the best team. They were all French. All of them. Zinedine Zidane and company, they are all French. I think he was born in North Africa, right? Algeria? Algeria. But he's French, they're all French, by the way. And everybody else is French. So the talk of the past is a little disturbing. It is [...] French. Now the French team is mixed, well it is Portuguese, but more and more it is of descendants. Our champion of triple jump, in languor, he was born... his parents are Cape Verdean. He was born in the Ivory Coast, I think. But he is Portuguese, finally. Our long jump champion, she was born in Angola, she is Portuguese. But they defend the Portuguese flag. But that they work. So they earn millions so they kick the ball, and that's it, that's it. They earn their lives. But then we have to know who are the best, who are not the good ones. Those who deserve, those who don't. We have to be tolerant of other people's culture. Islam, for example. We must tolerate them, of course. But then when it comes to women's rights, in particular, it scares me. It frightens me about women's rights. In Islam, it scares me. But in some aspects we have to be tolerant. Because there are things that would never change. Western culture can in some aspects help Muslim women to be more respected by her fathers. But there are some cultural traits that will never change. And religious that will never change. But we will have to respect the culture of others. If we want to be respected, we must respect others as well. We should not think that the western civilization is better than other civilizations. Of all orders. We must not think that way. Because otherwise, it is on the wrong basis. If we want to change what we have done for centuries and in a bad way sometimes the others, we cannot think that we are better than the others. Because civilization, the word civilization was not born in the West. Civilization, there are several, there is not only one civilization. Neither the Western one nor another. So that frightens me, this small speech, sincerely. A comment in off, there is a universal declaration of human right. Which must be respected by all the peoples of the world and despite that, despite the fact that European countries do not respect the declaration. There are some who... If the European countries do not respect it, there are many others who respect it much less. So, we must all together, in a universal way, respect this charter. Because we get used to it, we don't manage to overcome certain difficulties. And then there are some who put their head under the sand, who hide, or who look to the side, with the problem on the right, they look to the left. That way, we won't solve any problems. And finally... I promise you that in the next ten minutes I won't take the floor again. So the demographic question was divided into two - the population of Europe and the increase of non-white population in France and Germany. There are studies that tell us that in a few decades, the Muslim population may even exceed the Western population. Especially in France. Because Muslims in general have more children than other French people. They are all French, but there are Muslims, Muslims have more children than the white French. So I would like to solve the problem, because the subsidies, the compensations that are given to the Muslims in France are the same that are given to the whites who are in France. There is no difference. Everyone receives subsidies, allowances. So what we must have, more children. Yes, us, more children. That's the cultural difference. That's what we don't understand. Because we have a lifestyle. We want to preserve it. That it's compatible with one, two children. And even with two children, it's already complicated. It's complicated. We want to preserve this lifestyle. And these people, in a way these people don't have this concern. They have another lifestyle. And then we said here off the record that living in a gallery... no, we can't give gas to others. We are not better than others. We must help other people to evolve and develop. Because we have committed many crimes, many mistakes during all the centuries. We cannot forget the past. We have committed mistakes and crimes, certainly. [38 :04]

Um den Tisch herum war sehr interessant. Ich fühle mich persönlich sehr gut integriert in Dänemark. Ich glaube, das Problem der illegalen Einwanderer ist sicherlich ein Problem, welches von den entsprechenden Ländern geregelt werden soll. Ich spreche insbesondere von Asylanten. Wir haben nun Quoten gewählt. Wir hatten in der Vergangenheit Leute aus Tunesien, die aus […] auch in Dänemark eingeschifft wurden, und was auch wichtig ist, ist, dass Leute als Gäste in ein Land kommen – und das ist der Fall für Asylanten auch – sollen sie dankbar sein, dass sie da kommen dürfen. Und dann müssen sie sicherlich die Regeln respektieren, die in dem Land gelten. Das ist, glaube ich sehr wichtig. Und wenn die Kinder dieser Einwanderer in die Schulen in Dänemark kommen, dann gelten sie nicht mehr als Migranten, aber da kann die EU wahrscheinlich wenig unternehmen. Was dazu führt, dass eine ganze Reihe von Ländern sich besonders anstrengen muss, um dieses Problem zu regeln. Und das ist wirklich sehr komplex. [59:55]	"[57:52] Yeah, I was listening and I mean it was very interesting. Everything that was said here. Around the table has been very interesting. I personally feel very well integrated in Denmark. I think the problem of illegal immigrants is certainly a problem that should be regulated by the respective countries. I am talking about asylum seekers in particular. We have now chosen quotas. We had in the past people from Tunisia who were embarked from [...] also in Denmark, and what is also important is that people come to a country as guests - and that is the case for asylum seekers as well - they should be grateful that they are allowed to come there. And then they certainly have to respect the rules that apply in the country. That is, I think, very important. And when the children of these immigrants come to the schools in Denmark, then they are no longer considered migrants, but there is probably little the EU can do about that. Which leads to a whole bunch of countries having to make a special effort to sort out this problem. And it's really very complex. [59:55]

Punkt Nummer eins ist, dass man das wirklich überprüfen sollte, wer kommt, wie lange [ist er] in dem jeweiligen Land, inwieweit wird er gebraucht. Wichtigstes ist dabei, welche Qualifikationen bringt er dabei mit? Und das find ich super, was Mario gesagt hat, es war komplett. Wenn man sich so verhält, dann sind wir da, wo wir eigentlich schon sein hätten können. Dann haben wir nämlich die am qualifiziertesten Ausgebildeten und die, die benötigt werden. Das was richtig gesagt wurde, war, dass vorheriges Jahr ca. 5500 Ärzte aus Deutschland raus gegangen sind. Richtung Dänemark, Richtung Schweden, Richtung England. Da wird nämlich die Frage gestellt: Warum sind sie denn weg gegangen? Aus Deutschland, nach Spanien und Spanien unter anderem auch. Weil es ihnen dort von der Arbeitszeit einfach einmal besser geht und weil finanziell es sich für viele verbessert hat. Und dem Jens wollte ich privat nur sagen, sein Dokument hat er bei der Anreise verloren. Danke. [13:23]	"[12:14] So the Jürgen again here. I have to thank Mario, because he hit exactly the right words. Point number one is that you should really check who is coming, how long [is he] in the respective country, to what extent is he needed. The most important thing is, what qualifications does he bring with him? And I think that's great what Mario said, it was complete. If you behave like that, then we are where we actually could have been already. Because then we have the most qualified trained and the ones that are needed. What was said correctly was that last year about 5500 doctors left Germany. Towards Denmark, towards Sweden, towards England. Because the question is asked: Why did they leave? From Germany, to Spain and Spain among others. Because they are simply better off there in terms of working hours and because financially it has improved for many. And I just wanted to tell Jens privately that he lost his document when he arrived. Thank you. [13:23]

Und pro Beitragsjahr bekommt man letzten Endes nur vier Monate Arbeitslosengeld. Also man muss erst mal zwei Jahre gearbeitet haben, damit man überhaupt 8 Monate Anspruch auf Arbeitslosenunterstützung hat. Das durchschnittliche Arbeitslosengeld liegt im Moment bei 500/600 Euro, damit kann man kaum eine Familie am Leben erhalten. Und dann gibt es noch die sogenannte Familienhilfe, also wohl eine Art Sozialhilfe für Familien, das liegt bei 400 Euro, damit kann man auch keine Familie ernähren. Also ich sehe gar nicht, welchen Anreiz dann Migranten haben sollten, zu uns zu kommen. Sicher, sie haben Hunger, es sind hungrige Münder die zu uns kommen, das ist klar. Ich hab auch Erfahrungen sammeln können mit Einwanderern, mit Migranten. Ich hab festgestellt, Afrikaner sind oft viel solidarischer, viel bessere Menschen als wir. Auch viel dankbarer für Hilfe zum Beispiel als viele Europäer. Und deswegen sind wir auch nicht in der Lage, diese ganze Situation zu regeln oder zu lösen. Es gibt natürlich auch klare wirtschaftliche Vorteile, wenn man arbeitet, wenn nämlich auch Migranten Steuern zahlen und Sozialabgaben entrichten, dann würden sie auch einen Beitrag leisten für unsere Gesellschaft. Dann wären sie eben auch als gleichberechtigte Bürger anerkannt. Dann wären sie auch nicht in dieser Lage, wenn sie arbeiten dürften. Sie müssen eben in die gleiche Lage versetzt werden, müssen die gleichen Bedingungen haben, wie alle anderen Arbeitnehmer auch. Selbstverständlich, das ist meine persönliche Erfahrung, ich gebe jetzt hier nicht wieder, was man mir gesagt hat, was ich über Hörensagen erfahren hab. Das hab ich selber erfahren, selber miterlebt. Ich habe das auch miterlebt, wie man zum Beispiel mit Unternehmern umgegangen ist, die dann also Missbrauch betrieben hatten, und wie gesagt, die wurden sehr gut behandelt und hatten natürlich auch die Möglichkeit, sich anwaltlich unterstützten zu lassen und so weiter. Klar, wir müssen versuchen, sie wirklich zu integrieren die Migranten, damit nicht in jeder Hauptstadt, in jeder Provinz, in jeder Kleinstadt ein Ausländerghetto entsteht, ja? Sie müssen wirklich integriert werden, natürlich auch mit ihren Sitten und Gebräuchen, aber natürlich nicht nur mit ihren Sitten und Gebräuchen, sonst werden sie sich verschliessen, sich einschliessen in ihrer Gemeinschaft, in ihrem Ghetto. Weil gut, sie wandern aus Not ein mit ihrem ganzen Elend und sind natürlich auch die ersten, die unter diesem Elend oder neuem Elend, was da entsteht und Ghettoisierung zu leiden haben. [01:04:24]	"[01:00:19] In Germany, I don't know how much unemployment benefit there is; so with us, 60% of the last wage is paid out as unemployment benefit. And at the end of the day, per year of contribution, you only get four months of unemployment benefits. So you have to have worked for two years to be entitled to unemployment benefits for 8 months. The average unemployment benefit at the moment is 500/600 Euros, which is hardly enough to keep a family alive. And then there is the so-called family assistance, which is probably a kind of social assistance for families, which is 400 euros, with which you can also not feed a family. So I don't see what incentive migrants should have to come to us. Sure, they are hungry, they are hungry mouths that come to us, that is clear. I have also had experiences with immigrants, with migrants. I have noticed that Africans are often much more solidary, much better people than we are. They are also much more grateful for help than many Europeans. And that's why we are not in a position to regulate or solve this whole situation. Of course, there are also clear economic advantages to working, namely if migrants also pay taxes and social security contributions, then they would also contribute to our society. Then they would also be recognized as equal citizens. Then they would not be in this position if they were allowed to work. They just have to be put in the same position, have to have the same conditions as all other employees. Of course, this is my personal experience, I'm not going to repeat here what I've been told, what I've learned through hearsay. I have experienced it myself, witnessed it myself. I have also seen how, for example, entrepreneurs who had committed abuse were dealt with, and, as I said, they were treated very well and, of course, also had the opportunity to seek legal support and so on. Of course, we have to try to really integrate the migrants, so that a ghetto of foreigners doesn't develop in every capital city, in every province, in every small town, yes? They must be really integrated, of course also with their customs and traditions, but of course not only with their customs and traditions, otherwise they will close themselves off, shut themselves in their community, in their ghetto. Because well, they immigrate out of need with all their misery and are of course also the first to suffer from this misery or new misery, what arises there and ghettoization. [01:04:24]

Donc, en tout cas, j’ai lu quelque part, nous avons besoins de plus de 20 millions de personnes des pays tiers, donc en hors de l’Union Européenne, pour pouvoir satisfaire notre propre marché. Ça c’est le problème à long terme mais il y a également un problème à court terme qui a été cité par Micheline : Qu’est-ce que pouvons-nous faire ? Je pense que personne ne fait assez à l’heure actuelle pour accueillir les gens qui se trouvent déjà chez nous, mais il faut encore dire que la France au jour réside actuellement – depuis 200 ans est terre d’asile, donc un pays qui a toujours accueilli les étrangers, les immigrants et qui depuis des générations a fait beaucoup mais on constate également depuis deux générations maintenant – plus ou moins – en fait moins, on a vraiment des problèmes en France avec les immigrants et à ce moment-là il faudrait se poser la question, que faisons-nous à court terme pour pouvoir accueillir justement les gens dont nous avons encore besoin et que faison- nous pour ceux qui sont déjà là ? Et ce sont deux problèmes bien différents. Mais il faudrait s’approcher tout doucement. [24:34]	"22:11] So I don't know what your impression is but anyway, as I got all these proposals and when I read them, there are pros and cons but it seems like these last areas - but anyway, it's hard to make a decision because you can easily sign all the arguments in favor but also against. But I think it is a long term problem and at the same time a short term problem - I think that until 2030, due to the migratory change that we are going to live, we need 25 million immigrants until 2030, so at that time, we could immediately think of man as a commodity but on the other hand, we need this man, this commodity and therefore we have to be prepared, we have to be ready to welcome these people that we need. So, in any case, I read somewhere, we need more than 20 million people from third countries, outside the European Union, to satisfy our own market. This is the long-term problem, but there is also a short-term problem, which Micheline mentioned: What can we do? I think that nobody is doing enough at the moment to welcome the people who are already in our country, but it must be said that France has been a land of asylum for 200 years, a country that has always welcomed foreigners, But we have also noticed that for two generations now - more or less - we have really had problems in France with immigrants and at this point we should ask ourselves the question, what are we doing in the short term to be able to welcome the people we still need and what are we doing for those who are already here? These are two very different problems. But we should approach it very slowly. [24:34]

Aber wenn ich mir vorstelle, dass das Trinkwasser irgendwann sehr knapp wird durch Dürrekatastrophen und so weiter, dann wird die illegale Immigration immer mehr zunehmen Richtung Norden, nach Europa.

Donc ils viennent travailler chez nous, apprennent la langue, s’intègrent dans notre système ; ils sont toujours très courageux en train de travail et ils s’adaptent énormément bien. Un peu plus loin, il y a une ville, et là, il y a énormément d’étrangers. Il y a quelques années de cela, ces étrangers voulaient donc vraiment un peu barricader leur quartier ghetto. Ces gens se séparaient un peu des autres, faisaient cavaliers seuls, sous forme de ghetto pour ainsi dire, et  entre temps, s’est réglé. Alors, moi je ne fais aucune distinction entre l’aspect légal, illégale en matière d’immigration. Je crois que aussi longtemps que les gens respectent nos lois, notre cultures, notre - nos religions, le fait qu’ils vont travailler et qu’ils installent leurs gosses à l’école et bien je crois qu’il faut leur garantir le séjour. Encore une petite expérience à partir de ma prime jeunesse : J’avais donc une amie turque et ses parents en fait n’aiment guère que nous fréquentions et je trouve que ça c’est un peu fort de café quand-même cela. [07 :27]	"05:47] Yes, I wanted to say in terms of integration, exactly where I live in the neighborhood, there are people who came from Russia and in all my life I have never seen people as brave as them.

A little further away, there is a city, and there, there are a lot of foreigners. A few years ago, these foreigners really wanted to barricade their ghetto area. These people were separating themselves from the others, going it alone, in a ghetto form, so to speak, and in the meantime, it's settled. So, I don't make any distinction between the legal, illegal aspect of immigration. I believe that as long as people respect our laws, our culture, our - our religions, the fact that they go to work and put their kids in school, then I believe that they should be guaranteed to stay.

Das bringt ein anderes Weltbild mit sich. Denn dort basiert man sich auf die Moral, die direkt aus dem Koran kommt. Die Denkweise ist ganz anders. Die Vorstellung von der Moral ist ganz anders. In Teneriffa haben wir viele Probleme gehabt. Also ich bin Lehrkraft und ja mit dem Schleier, da gab es einiges an Problemen. Die jungen Mädchen kommen mit dem Schleier in die Schule. Wenn wir Bildung wünschen und Demokratie wünschen, was dann? Dann müssen doch alle gleich sein. Wir haben gesagt, wir möchten, dass der Schleier nicht angezogen wird und dann wurden die Kinder nicht mehr zur Schule geschickt. Eher dass, als dass die Eltern zugelassen hätten, dass der Schleier wegfällt. Dann gehen die Kinder nicht mehr zur Schule. Das war das Ergebnis. Auf den Kanarischen Inseln leben wir natürlich auch mit dem Tourismus. Die Deutschen, die Engländer kommen zu uns. Wir sind ein freundliches Gastland, aber es gibt demographischen Druck. Und früher war es bei uns ruhig, aber diese Ruhe ist weg. Und dann zu den Gefängnissen. Zu den Kriminellen, die angesprochen wurden. Unsere Gefängnisse, das sind Hotels, das ist bei uns also ganz anders als in anderen Ländern. Den Leuten geht’s gut. Sie haben zu Essen, die Leute werden versorgt, das ist bei uns ja nicht so normal. Zu den türkischen Mitbewohnern und ihre Integration: wir haben ein Problem mit Osteuropa, mit Leuten, die zu uns kamen, auf die kanarischen Inseln und da haben wir versucht, die Leute zu integrieren, wir hatten Lehrkräfte, die die sprachlichen Barrieren aufheben sollten. Das halt um zu ermöglichen, dass die Kinder zumindest die Landessprache beherrschen.  [49:03]	"[46:16] well, the philosophy of Islam is based on theocracy and not democracy. It makes a difference.

Rather that than that the parents would have allowed the veil to be dropped. Then the children don't go to school anymore. That was the result. In the Canary Islands, of course, we live with tourism. The Germans, the English come to us. We are a friendly host country, but there are demographic pressures. And it used to be quiet with us, but that quietness is gone. And then to the prisons. To the criminals that were addressed. Our prisons, they are hotels, so that is very different in our country than in other countries. The people are fine. They have food, people are taken care of, that's not so normal in our country. Regarding the Turkish residents and their integration: we have a problem with Eastern Europe, with people who came to us, to the Canary Islands, and there we tried to integrate the people, we had teachers who were supposed to remove the language barriers. That just to make it possible that the children at least know the local language.  [49:03]

Also Einwanderung ist für mich vor allem ein nationales Problem. Wie Thomas jedoch gesagt hat, da hat jedes Land eigentlich ein anderes, ein anders geartetes Einwanderungsproblem, das ist schon richtig. Im Süden von Spanien, in Südeuropa, nicht nur, aber auch in Spanien, da haben wir afrikanische Einwanderer, wie Sie wissen, wir haben auch viele Einwanderer aus lateinamerikanischen Ländern noch. Und, vielleicht haben wir da auch ein grösseres Problem als die nördlicheren Länder. Wir haben mehr Kolumbianer und Ecuadorianer als irgendwo anders in Europa und wir müssen da eigentlich den Anfang machen mit einer nationalen Politik, vielleicht eine gewisse Mindestschwelle oder Höchstschwelle festlegen für Einwanderer und sobald das geklärt ist, dann können wir vielleicht zu einer europäischen Politik übergehen. [36:46]	"[35:48] Yes, not exactly. So I didn't agree with one thing Thomas said. So immigration for me is primarily a national problem.

In the south of Spain, in southern Europe, not only, but also in Spain, we have African immigrants, as you know, we also have many immigrants from Latin American countries still. And, maybe we have a bigger problem there than the more northern countries. We have more Colombians and Ecuadorians than anywhere else in Europe and we actually have to start there with a national policy, maybe set a certain minimum threshold or maximum threshold for immigrants and once that's settled, then maybe we can move to a European policy.

Parce qu’on a constaté que dans la pratique il n’y a pas de politique et donc il faut créer une plateforme commune et donc ce soit vraiment une des grandes priorités parce que maintenant ils parlent tous mais personne n’ose vraiment intervenir. Donc il faut que ce soit vraiment une grande priorité et peut-être qu’un jour à ce moment-là une solution sera trouvé et puis pour moi aussi cette situation dans le document, donc une grande priorité consiste à ce que les différents pays puissent aussi augmenter les amendes données aux employeurs qui n’ont pas des illégaux, donc des amendes plus strictes, ce serait la solution. Donc évidemment maintenant il y a beaucoup de gens qui sont payés la moitié ou un quart de ce qu’il faudrait, il n’y a pas de cotisations sociales qui sont payées et cetera donc l’état devrait intervenir plus rigoureusement pour que ce soit vraiment fortement limité. [48:47]	"47:23] So what we could perhaps do is launch an appeal to the European Parliament so that they start to really develop a policy in this area. Because we have noticed that in practice there is no policy and so we need to create a common platform and so this should really be one of the main priorities because now they are all talking but nobody really dares to intervene. So it has to be a really big priority and maybe one day a solution will be found and then for me also this situation in the document, so a big priority is that the different countries can also increase the fines given to the employers who don't have illegals, so stricter fines, this would be the solution. So obviously now there's a lot of people who are paid half or a quarter of what they should be, there's no social contributions that are paid and so on so the state should intervene more rigorously so that it's really strongly limited.

Bloss weil die Sprache gleich ist, auch wenn es hilfreich ist, ist das kein Garant dafür, dass es eine Integration gibt. Es gibt andere Länder, die haben sehr viel mehr Übung. Schauen sie sich die Vereinigten Staaten an, die haben seit 200 Jahren zwei Bevölkerungsteile, einen Farbigen, einen Weissen und wenn man genau hinschaut, auch einen Hispanischen. Und die sind weit davon entfernt, ein homogenes Volk zu sein. Und wir werden auch kein homogenes Europa werden, egal ob wir ein EU-Parlament haben oder nicht. Und es ist auch gar nicht schlimm, dass es griechische Riten und Gebräuche gibt in Griechenland und deutsche Gebräuche in Deutschland. Aber schwierig wird es einfach, wenn man erwartet, dass Leute eben da zwischenleben, die das nicht teilen. Dann wird es immer komplizierter. Es gibt sicher Leute, die das akzeptieren und eben Rechte und Pflichten haben wollen, eben das Recht, hier zu leben, und deshalb auch die Pflicht bringen, sich zu integrieren. Aber eben – es ist nicht der Normalfall. Das kann man nicht sehen. Wir haben nur 2.4 Prozent Türken in Deutschland und trotzdem sind die Türken sozusagen die dominierende Ausländergruppe. [3:57]	"[2:39] so at this point I would like to contradict my two previous speakers in a way. Just because the language is the same, even if it's helpful, that's not a guarantee that there will be integration. There are other countries that have much more practice. Look at the United States, they've had two populations for 200 years, one colored, one white, and if you look closely, one Hispanic. And they are far from being a homogeneous people. And we are not going to become a homogeneous Europe, whether we have an EU parliament or not. And it's not bad at all that there are Greek rites and customs in Greece and German customs in Germany. But it becomes difficult when you expect people to live there who don't share that. Then it becomes more and more complicated. There are certainly people who accept this and want to have rights and duties, the right to live here, and therefore also the duty to integrate. But just - it is not the normal case. You can't see that. We have only 2.4 percent Turks in Germany and yet the Turks are, so to speak, the dominant group of foreigners. [3:57]

Denn wenn ein Land ausschert und quasi, ich nehm jetzt ein Beispiel, Portugal beschliesst alle illegalen Einwanderer sind gar nicht mehr illegal, dann sind die ja quasi legal, können durch die EU- Freizügigkeit überall hin und wir haben alle wieder das Problem. Also würden wir dann wieder in ein Nationalstaat-Problem zurückgreifen, wo jeder dann seine eigene Lösung finden muss. Also entweder wir tun alle was und sind uns da einig, oder jeder muss es irgendwie für sich lösen. Aber ich denke, der Sinn der EU ist, dass wir gemeinsam an dieser Lösung agieren und nicht einfach die Länder, die am meisten betroffen sind, erstmal sozusagen ihren eigenen Problemen überlassen. Klar sind wir Mitteleuropäer fein raus, weil wir immer sagen können, die Illegalen kommen aus dem nächsten Land, da können wir sie erstmal zurück schicken. Ist auch sehr schön populär, denn da ist ja auch kein Krieg oder so. aber wir müssen uns schon klar sein, wie unpopulär diese Massnahmen in den Grenzländern, also Grenzländern der EU sind. Und die müssen wir einfach unterstützen. Da geht kein Weg daran vorbei.

Because if a country breaks away and, I'll take an example now, Portugal decides that all illegal immigrants are no longer illegal, then they are quasi-legal, they can go everywhere because of the EU freedom of movement, and we all have the problem again. So we would then fall back into a nation-state problem, where everyone has to find his own solution. So either we all do something and agree on it, or everyone has to solve it somehow for themselves. But I think the point of the EU is that we act together on this solution and not just leave the countries that are most affected to their own problems, so to speak, for now. Of course, we Central Europeans are in the clear, because we can always say that the illegals come from the next country, so we can send them back first. It's also very popular, because there's no war or anything, but we have to be aware of how unpopular these measures are in the border countries, i.e. the border countries of the EU. And we simply have to support them. There is no way around it. And that's where we should take up Wolf's question, how we are prepared to have our politicians actually enforce these unpopular measures. [13:58]

Wir dürfen aber nicht vergessen, dass es Entwicklungshilfe aus drei Gründen gibt: Erstens, wir wollen einen Wirtschaftspartner irgendwann mal haben, der unsere Sachen abkauft. Zweitens, wir wollen nicht, dass da unten ein Krieg ausbricht, das heisst, wir wollen die – ja das Sozialgefüge stärken und erst in dritter Hinsicht ist es völlig humanitär. Wenn jetzt aber so ein Staat, dem wir Auflage geben, bitte halte deine Leute in deinem Land, sich daran nicht hält oder nicht so hält wie wir, sind wir dann wirklich zu dieser unpopulären Massnahme dann bereit, die Entwicklungshilfe dort einzustellen, mit der Konsequenz, dass es dort eigentlich die Falschen trifft. Denn die, die es zu verantworten haben, sind ja sozusagen die Regierenden, im Zweifelsfall auch mal die regierende Kaste dieses Landes, und nicht die Leute, die aus diesem Land versuchen raus zu kommen um zu uns zu kommen. Und dann sind wir jetzt wieder bei Wolf’s Eingangsfrage: Wie viel trauen wir uns? Und unser Hauptproblem in dem Zusammenhang ist einfach, dass wir als EU ja keinen Ansprechpartner wie eine Afrikanische Union haben, ansonsten könnten wir natürlich sagen, wir schicken euch alle Illegalen an die Afrikanische Union, guckt mal, wie ihr sie wieder verteilt kriegt und macht das bitte sehr schön nett und angenehm für diese Menschen, ja? Nein, die werfen einfach ihren Pass weg und wir müssen rauskriegen ob sie Marokkaner oder Albaner oder sonst was sind, ja? [61:14]	"[59:45] So I agree 100% with the development aid as well. But we have to remember that development aid exists for three reasons: One, we want to have an economic partner at some point to buy our stuff. Second, we don't want a war to break out down there, that is, we want to strengthen the - yes, the social fabric, and only in the third respect is it completely humanitarian. But if a state, to which we have given an order to please keep your people in your country, does not comply or does not comply in the same way as we do, are we then really prepared to take this unpopular measure of stopping development aid there, with the consequence that it actually hits the wrong people there. Because those who have to take the responsibility are, so to speak, the governing caste of this country, and not the people who try to get out of this country to come to us. And then we're back to Wolf's initial question: How much do we dare? And our main problem in this context is simply that we as the EU don't have a contact like an African Union, otherwise we could of course say, we'll send all you illegals to the African Union, see how you get them distributed again and please make it very nice and pleasant for these people, yes? No, they just throw away their passport and we have to find out if they are Moroccan or Albanian or whatever, yeah? [61:14]

Qui ne cotisent pas tellement en fait, je pense que si toutes les immigrées travaillaient, on n’aurait pas tellement un souci. J’ai l’impression de vue de loin que justement regroupement familial, compagnie, ça fait beaucoup de monde et je ne fait pas de jugement là-dessus mais le fait que, quand on voit tous les clandestines afghanes et pakistanais qui veulent en Grande Bretagne, eux, ils veulent passer pour travailler. Ça semble clair. Et on les empêche de passer lors qu’ils veulent travailler. Et il y a en a beaucoup qui sont là mais, je ne suis pas sur qu’ils veulent vraiment travailler. Alors, cette question est tabou aussi, parce que si on dit qu’on est anti-immigrés, puis, je crois que la question n’est pas la mais il y a une immigration pour le travail et une immigration même si l’adaptation était difficile, aussi qu’au niveau de protection social, une couverture qui n’est pas […].

Viele, die wissen, die geschickt sind, wie man es hinbekommt, in ein Land einzuwandern und andere eben nicht. Wir haben ja Länder wo bestimmte Fachkräfte gebraucht werden. Zum Beispiel fehlt es in Spanien an Ärzten. Also zum Beispiel, man geht in eine Poliklinik in Spanien und man muss fast drei Tage warten auf ein Gespräch mit einem Kinderarzt, weil wir eben Ärztemangel haben. Und dann stellt man die Frage, ja studiert bei uns keiner Medizin bei uns? Ja doch, aber die jungen spanischen Ärzte, die arbeiten in England, in Portugal, im Ausland, weil sie dort das Doppelte verdienen. Die Einkommen der Ärzte in Spanien sind sehr sehr niedrig. Man verdient einfach viel mehr in England oder in vielen anderen europäischen Ländern in der Medizin. Das ist mal eine Sache. Und dann: ich bin auch nicht dafür, dass wir alle rein lassen und sagen alles ist in Ordnung, nein. Es gibt eben Orte, die nicht mehr aufnahmefähig sind, ja? Wenn man natürlich in ein Land geht, dann muss man sich an die dort geltenden Normen und Werte auch halten, sich richtig verhalten. Und man ist nicht da um alles zu vernichten, kaputt zu machen. Meine Eltern haben zum Beispiel in Deutschland gearbeitet, ich bin in Deutschland geboren, in Frankfurt, und meine Eltern haben dort gearbeitet, fünf oder sechs Jahre glaub ich, haben sie in Deutschland gearbeitet. Aber meine Eltern, als sie nach Deutschland gingen damals hatten sie schon eine Arbeit gefunden, ja? Von Spanien aus hatten sie sich schon um Arbeit bemüht. Und dann kamen sie in ihre Fabrik; sie hatten auch schon eine Wohnung dort, haben dann sechs Jahre dort gearbeitet, um eben auch Geld zu verdienen, um eben Möbel, Einrichtungsgegenstände, Fernseher zu kaufen, sogar eine Wohnung, und dann sind sie nach Spanien zurückgegangen und da bin ich dann weiter aufgewachsen. Also die Spanier, die in Deutschland gearbeitet haben, sind dort hingegangen, um dort zu arbeiten. Das Problem ist, in Spanien; ich bin auch gar nicht gegen Einwanderung, aber es gibt sehr sehr viele Menschen, die nach Spanien kommen, die sagen, wir wollen dort arbeiten, aber es stimmt nicht. Die kommen dorthin, um zu stehlen, ja? Zumindest in Madrid. In Madrid ist es so, viele hassen oder haben Angst vor Rumänen. Die Leute kaufen sich ne Wohnung und wenn man eine Wohnung kauft, und dann ziehen dort in das Gebäude ein Ecuadorianer, zum Beispiel, Marokkaner, oder andere Menschen aus Lateinamerika. Also, wie gesagt, die Leute versuchen dann sofort, ihre Wohnung wieder zu verkaufen. Das wäre auch dumm, sagen alle, du musst da möglichst schnell wieder ausziehen, deine Wohnung verkaufen, weil sie einfach schnell an Wert verliert. Also ein Herr, der jetzt auch in der Regierung ist, stellt fast allen Arbeits- und Aufenthaltsgenehmigungen aus, und jetzt viele sagen natürlich, kommt jetzt schnell nach Spanien, weil irgendwann werden sie die Grenzen wieder zumachen. Und die, die dann arbeitslos werden - ist es so ja dann sollen sie sobald sie arbeitslos werden, zurück in ihr Land gehen, dann können sie dort Arbeitslosengeld beziehen. Aber das ist nicht so. Sie gehen zurück in ihr Land, beziehen dort Arbeitslosengeld und dann kommen sie wieder zurück. Die bleiben dann nicht in ihrem Heimatland. [42:37]	"[38:15] Yeah, I'm not for selective immigration now, that they say you can come. Many who know, who are skilled, how to manage to immigrate to a country and others just not. We have countries where certain skilled workers are needed. For example, in Spain there is a lack of doctors. For example, you go to an outpatient clinic in Spain and you have to wait almost three days for a consultation with a pediatrician because we have a shortage of doctors. And then you ask the question, yes, doesn't anyone study medicine in our country? Yes, but the young Spanish doctors work in England, in Portugal, abroad, because they earn twice as much there. The income of doctors in Spain is very very low. You simply earn much more in England or in many other European countries in medicine. That's one thing. And then: I'm also not for letting everybody in and saying everything is fine, no. There are just places that are no longer receptive, yes? Of course, when you go to a country, you have to abide by the norms and values that apply there, you have to behave properly. And you are not there to destroy everything, to break everything. My parents, for example, worked in Germany, I was born in Germany, in Frankfurt, and my parents worked there, five or six years I think, they worked in Germany. But my parents, when they went to Germany then they had already found a job, yes? From Spain, they had already tried to find work. And then they came to their factory; they already had an apartment there, and then they worked there for six years in order to earn money, to buy furniture, furnishings, televisions, even an apartment, and then they went back to Spain and that's where I grew up. So the Spaniards who worked in Germany went there to work. The problem is, in Spain; I'm not against immigration at all, but there are very very many people who come to Spain who say we want to work there, but it's not true. They come there to steal, right? At least in Madrid. In Madrid it's like that, many hate or are afraid of Romanians. People buy an apartment, and when you buy an apartment, and then an Ecuadorian, for example, Moroccan, or other people from Latin America move there in the building. So, as I said, people then immediately try to sell their apartment again. That would also be stupid, everyone says, you have to move out of there as quickly as possible, sell your apartment, because it simply loses value quickly. So a gentleman, who is now also in the government, issues almost all work and residence permits, and now many say of course, come now quickly to Spain, because at some point they will close the borders again. And those who then become unemployed - is it so yes then they should go back to their country as soon as they become unemployed, then they can draw unemployment benefits there. But that's not the case. They go back to their country, receive unemployment benefits there and then they come back. They don't stay in their home country then. [42:37]

Das ist nämlich so, wenn jetzt jemand aus dem Visa-Status rausfällt und in dem Moment als illegaler Einwanderer behandelt wird, dann hat er auch kein Recht auf Arbeit und das müsste geändert werden, dass eben diese Kriminalisierung raus kommt, weil vorher durfte er ja arbeiten mit dem Visa. Aber wenn er auf einmal in die Mühlen der Justiz gerät mit der Illegalität und dann ist er illegal in dem jeweiligen Land oder ich rede jetzt mal von Deutschland, dann bekommt er das, wenn er schon mal in dem Status der Illegalität drin ist, dann kommt er nicht wider in den Status der Legalität rein, dass er dann wieder ein legales Visa erwerben kann und das ist das was vielleicht die EU mal europaweit ändern sollte, eben diese Sache, dass man da auf einen Nenner kommt, dass wenn jemand schon mal legal gearbeitet hat und das Visa läuft ab, dass er dann – was weiss ich – also jedenfalls nicht in die Illegalität gerät sondern einfach mal so in einen Status gerät, wie wenn er jetzt irgend eine Gebühr nicht bezahlt hat, die er halt dann wieder verlängern müsste. Das wäre einfacher, dann hätten wir auch die Zahlen nicht so. [44:29]	"[42:25] So that is the key point what you are saying Manfred. Why don't you just extend their visa? Because if someone falls out of the visa status and is treated as an illegal immigrant at that moment, then he also has no right to work and that would have to be changed so that this criminalization comes out, because before he was allowed to work with the visa. But if he suddenly gets into the mills of justice with the illegality and then he is illegal in the respective country or I'm talking about Germany, then he gets that, if he is already in the status of illegality, then he does not come back into the status of legality purely, that he can then acquire a legal visa again and that is what perhaps the EU should change times Europe-wide, This is the thing that perhaps the EU should change throughout Europe, so that one comes to a common denominator, that if someone has already worked legally and the visa expires, that he then - what do I know - so in any case does not get into illegality but simply gets into a status, as if he has not paid some fee, which he would then have to extend again. That would be easier, then we wouldn't have the numbers like that. [44:29]

Und deshalb gefällt mir auch das Beispiel mit den Tomaten gar nicht, da einfach nicht aufrechenbar ist, dass wir billige Tomaten haben, gegen von mir aus Kriminalität, also da ausgeben müssen. Und wenn wir ehrlich sind, Leute, die hierherkommen und die wir behalten, müssen wir genau so behandeln wie die Leute, die hier geboren sind. Aber ein Gemeinsystem geht doch nur, wenns einigermassen homogen ist. Und wenns nur lokal homogen ist. Das ist das Problem unserer griechischen Freunde mit ihren türkischen Nachbarn. Da es eine komplett andere Kultur dort einsickert und es einfach zu Spannungen kommt. Wir hatten das auch früher. Da ging es um die evangelischen und die Katholischen. Die Differenzen werden einfach immer grösser, je weiter her die Leute kommen. Und es gibt eigentlich keinen Grund, nicht dafür zu sorgen, dass die Leute, dort wo sie wohnen, auch glücklich gemacht werden. Damit sie keinen Grund mehr haben, herzukommen. Das muss möglich sein. [7:56]	"[6:59] Yes, I would then, that's exactly where I would like to start. And that's why I don't like the example with the tomatoes at all, because it's just not offsettable that we have cheap tomatoes, versus from me crime, so have to spend there. And if we're honest, people who come here and we keep, we have to treat just like the people who are born here. But a community system only works if it is somewhat homogeneous. And if it is only locally homogeneous. This is the problem of our Greek friends with their Turkish neighbors. Because a completely different culture seeps in there and it simply comes to tensions. We also had that in the past. There it was about the Protestants and the Catholics. The differences just get bigger and bigger the further away people come. And there is really no reason not to make sure that the people where they live are also made happy. So that they have no more reason to come here. That has to be possible. [7:56]

Der Lebensstandard in Deutschland ist ja höher, liegt höher als in Polen, deswegen ist es auch nur verständlich, dass die Lebenshaltungskosten teuer sind. Ich darf ein Beispiel aus meiner Gegend anführen und ein paar konkrete Beispiele, aber darf ich ruhig vielleicht auch mein Beispiel anführen: Also ich, was ich verdiene und dann alle Nebenkosten, also ich bekomme brutto 2000 Zloty, das entspricht 500 Euro, also ein Viertel ungefähr, und wenn ich also dann die Versicherungsbeiträge und andere unverzichtbare Ausgaben abgezogen habe, bleiben mir gerade mal die Hälfte, 1000 Zloty und ein Quadratmeter Wohnfläche kostet also sechs Zloty, das heisst also, ich weiss jetzt nicht, wie man das umrechnen kann. Ich versuche nur, das in logischen Zusammenhang zu bringen mit dem, was ich feststelle bei Abwandern, denn eine polnische Familie muss in etwa 90 Zloty allein für den Strom ausgeben. Sie können sich also selbst ausrechnen, dass die Lebenshaltungskosten unverhältnismässig liegen. Also ich bin nicht der Meinung, dass das Leben in Deutschland teurer sei als in Polen, das kann ich nicht nachvollziehen. [26:47]	"[24:55] I would like to add something. The standard of living in Germany is higher than in Poland, so it is understandable that the cost of living is expensive. I may give an example from my area and a few specific examples, but may I calmly maybe also give my example: So I, what I earn and then all additional expenses, so I get gross 2000 zloty, which corresponds to 500 euros, so a quarter approximately, and if I then deducted the insurance premiums and other indispensable expenses, I am left with just half, 1000 zloty and a square meter of living space costs six zloty, so that is, I do not know now how you can convert that. I'm just trying to put it into a logical context with what I find out when I move, because a Polish family has to spend about 90 zloty on electricity alone. So you can do the math yourself that the cost of living is disproportionate. So I don't agree that living in Germany is more expensive than living in Poland, I can't understand that. [26:47]
