jlev: level of justification
(0) The speaker does not present any argument or only says that X should or should not be done, but no reason is given.

(3)Sophisticated Justification (broad): At least two complete justifications are given, either two complete justifications for the same demand or complete justifications for two different demands.
(4) Sophisticated Justification (in depth): At least two complete justifications are given, either two complete justifications for the same demand or complete justifications for two different demands and discussed in d
